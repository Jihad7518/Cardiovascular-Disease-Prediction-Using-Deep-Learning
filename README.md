# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict cardiovascular disease using deep learning techniques. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality globally, and early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes. This repository contains datasets, code, and documentation for developing and evaluating deep learning models for cardiovascular disease prediction.

## Datasets
- A curated collection of datasets related to cardiovascular disease is included in this repository. Each dataset contains relevant features and labels necessary for training and evaluating predictive models.

## Research Papers
- This project references various research papers on cardiovascular disease prediction. Summaries of these papers, including key findings and methodologies, are provided for further insights into the domain.

## Data Analysis
- The `notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb` notebook conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the selected dataset(s). Visualizations and insights are presented to understand the data's characteristics and identify potential patterns related to cardiovascular disease.

## Machine Learning Models (Optional)
- If applicable, this repository may include notebooks or scripts for traditional machine learning models such as regression, support vector machines (SVM), or decision trees. These models serve as baselines for comparison with deep learning approaches.

## Deep Learning Models
- The `notebooks/deep_learning_models.ipynb` notebook or scripts contain implementations of deep learning models for cardiovascular disease prediction. Different architectures and techniques are explored to leverage the predictive power of neural networks.
