# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict cardiovascular disease using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project explores various datasets, conducts data analysis, and implements predictive models to identify individuals at risk of cardiovascular diseases.

## Datasets
- The project includes a curated collection of datasets related to cardiovascular disease from various sources. Detailed information about each dataset, including the number of samples, features, and data sources, can be found in the `docs/datasets.md` file.

## Research Papers
- A compilation of relevant research papers on cardiovascular disease prediction is provided in the `docs/research_papers.md` file. Each paper is summarized briefly, highlighting key findings and methodologies.

## Data Analysis
- The `notebooks/cardio_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the selected dataset(s). Visualizations and insights gained from the data are presented, helping to understand the characteristics of the data and identify potential patterns.

## Machine Learning Models
- The `notebooks/cardio_ml_models.ipynb` notebook explores various machine learning models, including regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and others. Model training, evaluation metrics, and comparisons are provided to determine the most effective approach for cardiovascular disease prediction.

## Deep Learning Models
- The `notebooks/cardio_deep_learning_models.ipynb` notebook or scripts contain the implementation of deep learning models for cardiovascular disease prediction. Different architectures and techniques are explored to leverage the predictive power of neural networks.
